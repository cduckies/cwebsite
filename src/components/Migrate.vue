        <p>Crypto Duckies started the migration to their own ERC-721 contract (more info on <a href="https://discord.gg/cryptoduckies" target="_blank">Discord</a> or the <a href="https://migrate.cryptoduckies.co" target="_blank">Migration</a> page). Every migrated duck will be able to mint a free GAN version of their duckie shortly, but we are also introducing migration milestone rewards; where at every milestone outlined below, weâ€™ll be hosting giveaways. </p>
